<p>Every construction project comes with its share of uncertainties. From unexpected site conditions to last-minute design changes, the risks can quickly add up and derail even the best-laid plans. This is where a <strong>construction contingency</strong> comes in — your financial safety net to cover unforeseen costs and keep the project on track. </p>



<p>Whether you’re a contractor or property owner, understanding construction contingencies can make all the difference in managing your budget and avoiding costly surprises.</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-935648f4d767a7a600b24c6926b02027" style="color:#6fb113">What Is a Construction Contingency?</h2>



<p>A <strong>construction contingency</strong> is a reserved portion of the project budget set aside to cover unexpected costs or risks that arise during construction. Think of it as an emergency fund specifically for your construction project. It’s designed to address unforeseen expenses without disrupting the overall budget or timeline.</p>



<p><strong>For example</strong>, if your project encounters unexpected soil conditions requiring additional excavation, the contingency can absorb these costs without requiring additional funding or causing delays.</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-ae2a9cf835b03a53b6c41708877c342d" style="color:#6fb113">Why Is a Construction Contingency Important?</h2>



<p>Construction projects rarely go exactly as planned. That’s why having a contingency is essential for:</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Managing Change Orders:</strong> Changes in scope or design during construction are common, and contingencies help cover these adjustments.</li>



<li><strong>Handling Unexpected Conditions:</strong> From weather delays to unforeseen site issues, contingencies provide financial flexibility.</li>



<li><strong>Preventing Budget Overruns:</strong> Without a contingency, unexpected costs can lead to financial strain or project delays.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>Did you know?</strong> Cost overruns and delays are often a reality in large construction projects, but they don’t have to be. According to experts from <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://news.columbia.edu/news/how-avoid-cost-overruns-and-delays-big-infrastructure" target="_blank" data-type="link" data-id="https://news.columbia.edu/news/how-avoid-cost-overruns-and-delays-big-infrastructure" rel="noreferrer noopener">Columbia University</a></span>, taking proactive steps like having a solid contingency plan and using integrated contracts can help keep projects on track. </p>

<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-3e6d749e4bdc6620553a68d4a416b595" style="color:#6fb113">Types of Construction Contingencies</h2>



<p>Construction contingencies come in three main types: <strong>Owner Contingency</strong>, <strong>Contractor Contingency</strong>, and <strong>Design Contingency</strong>.</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Owner Contingency:</strong> Reserved by the property owner to handle changes initiated on their end, such as additional features or upgrades.</li>



<li><strong>Contractor Contingency:</strong> Allocated by the contractor for unforeseen costs within their scope, like material price fluctuations.</li>



<li><strong>Design Contingency:</strong> Used during the design phase to address adjustments or refinements in plans.</li>
</ol>



<p>For instance, a contractor might use their contingency to absorb higher-than-expected costs for materials, while the owner’s contingency might cover an upgrade to premium flooring.</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-0d9b732a3ad42a94cc5c4d8c60900332" style="color:#6fb113">How to Calculate a Construction Contingency</h2>



<p>Calculating the right contingency amount depends on factors like project complexity and risk level. A general guideline is to allocate 5-10% of the total project budget for contingencies. Here’s how:</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Assess Project Risks:</strong> Identify potential risks, such as location-specific challenges or material shortages.</li>



<li><strong>Determine a Percentage:</strong> Use historical data and risk assessment to decide on a percentage. For complex projects, a higher percentage may be warranted.</li>



<li><strong>Incorporate into the Budget:</strong> Include the contingency as a distinct line item in your budget.</li>
</ol>



<p>For example, if your project budget is $1 million, a 10% contingency means setting aside $100,000 to cover unforeseen costs.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-4315352a9a59dc7d1da7cf1a2cdfb2b2" style="color:#6fb113">Common Mistakes in Managing Construction Contingencies</h2>



<p>Avoid these pitfalls to make the most of your contingency:</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Underestimating the Contingency Amount:</strong> Setting aside too little can leave you exposed to risks.</li>



<li><strong>Failing to Track Usage:</strong> Proper documentation ensures the contingency is used effectively.</li>



<li><strong>Misusing Contingency Funds:</strong> Using the contingency for non-essential upgrades can deplete it prematurely.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Regularly review and adjust your contingency allocation using a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://builtfront.com/blog/construction-management-software/" data-type="link" data-id="https://builtfront.com/blog/construction-management-software/">construction management software</a></span>, as the project progresses to align with emerging risks.</p>
